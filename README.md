# TwitterScrape_Academic_API_V2 is a page that I created with codes for my master's thesis that I performed. 
# I wanted to share the codes I used since they helped me imensely to reach my studie's goal (on which more down below).

# In this study I investigated the effect of online word-of-mouth (e-wom) volume on the watch hours of a movie in the Netflix top 10 and how the use of big name celebrities in these movies (Star Power) influences this effect.

# Note: The codes provided in this repository are changed so my variables, api key, and other study-specific information are changed into more general words that show what is suposed to be there. For example: my independent variable has changed to the words INDEPENDENT_VARIABLE or my API key has changed to the words YOUR_OWN_TWITTER_API_V2_KEY.
